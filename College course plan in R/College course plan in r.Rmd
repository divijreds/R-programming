## Evaluation
Course grade will depend on continuous evaluation basis and performance in the class and Course evaluation of marks will be based on the following deliverables:

### Grading Policy
>Theory(100 Marks)

|Padagogy          |    Frequency  |    Marks         |
|:-----------------|:--------------|:-----------------|
|  Internal Exam   | 2             |  20 Mark         |
|  Attendence      | -             |  10 Mark         |
|  Assignment      | 1             |  10 Mark         |
|  University Exam | 1             |  60 Mark         |

>Practical(50 Marks)

|Padagogy          |    Frequency  |    Marks         |
|:-----------------|:--------------|:-----------------|
|  Internal Exam   | 10            |  15 Mark         |
|  Attendence      | -             |  05 Mark         |
|  Take Away Task  | 1             |  10 Mark         |
|  Practical Exam  | 2             |  10 Mark         |
|  VIVA Exam       | 1             |  10 Mark         |

Course will be graded out of 100 marks and above table shows the significance weight of continuous performance system in marks. The grades will be in accordance with Ganpat university policy.

## Supplementary materials*


In case, if text book sounds uncomfortable or due to lack of access of text book if any one fail to follow the text book then supplementary materials will be provided on moodle as and when the topic covered in class "*" denotes optional readings.

## Prerequisites
Students are requested to go through the content covered in R Programming. It is essential to have hands on practice of programming languages. Students are also recommended to refer MATLAB and python tool and its programs.

## End Semester Exam
Ganpat University will conduct end semester exam and cover the entire course.

## Internal Exam
The internal exam will be in class. Announcement of the date will be done in class and on the web page when the term starts. It is mandatory.

(Note: These exams may be offered as open book exam).

## Advice on exams
The exams are designed to test understanding of the material by going beyond the examples that have been discussed in class. Assignments and class examples are not representative of the problems in exams. I recommend preparing for the exam by working through practice exams posted on Blackboard.

## Assignments
There are assignments (problem sets and cases), some requiring the use of a PC and program; the assignments may be submitted by groups of up to three; working on the homework in groups is highly recommended. Answers should be clear and explanatory (the solution and how you obtained it); Assignment due dates are given on the course outline and are non-negotiable - in the interest of fairness and as required by the honor code, all students should face the same set of deadlines.

## Advice on Assignments
The main objective of the Assignment is to help you learn by preparing for the class and thinking about the material. An advice is to do best answering the homework questions, but recognize that they are hard and meant to make you think. The best gauge is whether you understand the issues and the solutions that are handed out.

## Regrade Requests
Requests for reconsideration of grading must be submitted in writing within a week of when the material is returned. If a regarded is requested, the entire material will be re-evaluated. The regarded must be based entirely on own work and performance.

The standards for Academic Integrity strictly apply. Exams must be completed independently and within the allotted time. Only the specifically allowed materials may be used and nothing else. On the Assignments any one can consult with any other class members and refer to class materials, except that answers to previous yearsâ€™ problems are off limits.
